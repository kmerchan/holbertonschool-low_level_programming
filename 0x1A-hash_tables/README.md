# 0x1A-hash_tables
This directory contains initial work with hash tables and hash functions in C:

0. Writing a function that creates a hash table with an array of a given size
1. Writing a hash function to implement the djb2 algorithm to use in future tasks
2. Writing a function that returns the index of a key using hash_djb2
3. Writing a function that adds a new element to the hash table
4. Writing a function that returns the value associated with a specific key
5. Writing a function to print hash table key/value pairs in the order they appear in the array
6. Writing a function to delete a hash table
